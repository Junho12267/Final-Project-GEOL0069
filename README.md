# Interpolating Sea level anomalies based on eddies in Southern ocean

### Purpose of the project
Based on Sallee J.B.,2018, the Southern Ocean has been warming at 0.1 to 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade from the surface to 1000m in depth due to anthropogenic emissions. Bateson et.al, 2020 suggest that the warming world causes sea ice floes to be smaller, which leads to a parameter-to-area ratio and leads to faster melting, which increases the sea ice leads as ice cracks more easily. Hence, using the along-track analysis, it will be possible to find out which region in the Southern Ocean has the most lead and ice to understand its vulnerability to global warming.
