# Using Along-Track Analysis for the Southern Ocean 

### Purpose of the project
The purpose of the project is to interpolate the location of sea ice and lead in the Southern Ocean using the GPOD (Grid Processing On Demand) data. This is useful as the interpolation of floes and leads helps to create a simulation on how sea ice deforms, even though this is not always a straightforward process. ( Hutter and Losch 2020). The most useful application of this is understanding climate change, especially in polar regions, as the deformation of sea ice is highly sensitive to temperature.
