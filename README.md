# Interpolating Sea level anomalies based on eddies in the Southern ocean

### Purpose of the project
The purpose of this project is to interpolate sea level anomaly in the Southern Ocean using the eddies observed in Sentinel 2 altimetry. ( Pegliasco et al.,2022)) Based on Sallee J.B.,2018, the Southern Ocean has been warming at 0.1 to 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade from the surface to 1000m in depth due to anthropogenic emissions.
