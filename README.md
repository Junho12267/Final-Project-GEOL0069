# Interpolating Sea level anomalies based on eddies in Southern ocean

### Purpose of the project
The purpose of the project is to interpolate the location of sea ice and lead in the Southern Ocean using the GPOD (Grid Processing On Demand) data. This is useful as the interpolation of floes and leads helps to create a simulation on how sea ice deforms, even though this is not always a straightforward process. ( Hutter and Losch 2020). The most useful application of this is understanding climate change in polar regions, as the deformation of sea ice is highly sensitive to temperature. Based on Sallee J.B.,2018, the Southern Ocean has been warming at 0.1 to 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade from the surface to 1000m in depth due to anthropogenic emissions. Bateson et.al, 2020 suggest that the warming world causes sea ice floes to be smaller, which leads to a parameter-to-area ratio and leads to faster melting, which increases the sea ice leads as ice cracks more easily. Hence, using the along-track analysis, it will be possible to find out which region in the Southern Ocean has the most lead and ice to understand its vulnerability to global warming.
