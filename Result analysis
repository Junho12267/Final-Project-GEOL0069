**Result summary**

Firstly, the altimetry data from sentinel 3 shows that even in southern hemisphere summer ( Data is from January 2019),
there is significant amount of sea ice left near the coast in Weddell sea which is in the zone of the area of interest. 
This is likely because the Weddell Sea has many multi-year sea ice which does not melt even in summer due to low temperature 
caused by Weddell current.
